This is the home page for my github site. 
I eventually want to try and get up some alternate pages, built from adapting templates I download, but the first thing I need to do is:

+make a new download page for runeshadow
+finish this readme.
+update changes on github.
This sentence should now, after a pull request and merge, show up online.

FINISHED:
-get rid of smashwords widget.
