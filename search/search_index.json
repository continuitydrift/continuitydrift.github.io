Bring warm clothes and flashlights. Lines will be largely improvised, and the performance will be immediately followed by a meeting where, after check-ins, consensus will be reached on how funny it was (no one is allowed to leave early).</p> <p>This production of the Clouds will be a loving, self-aware satire of intellectual pretensions, performed by one or more actors, with at least one of the speeches memorized beforehand. There will be lewd and suggestive language, the active questioning of authority, and musical performances. The audience may be participated with, with care and consent.</p> <p>Rehearsals are optional, and open to the curious, especially if you want to contribute acting, constumes, set design, choreography, or music.

Then it displays a number of sections, according to their level of interest. The next question might be \"how much time do you have?\" with a slider bar or choices one through six, and this determines how long each section is, how much hidden text is revealed. </p> <p>If you are reading this, and your answer is low for either question, then you can safely stop after this paragraph, [executive] summary of what's below. </p> <p>~</p> <p>They were a repurposer of worlds.
