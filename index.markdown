This is, as much as any other file, as much as any other doorway opening up into the cyber realms I've first imagined mentally, as a hexagonal map spiking out into orthagonals, a place to begin.

I was thinking of live-streaming the creation of this index, but decided to record it instead, with grainy footage of the built-in web cam for the laptop on which I am working, an old keyboard plugged into a usb port.

I don't know, I imagine a sort of layering, an incremental editing. Github, like some jealous lover, preserves every snapshot of past versions, adhering to the mythology of nothing-ever-lost. And yet it is. Life is dying, memory is forgetting, and in order to write these sentences I have to turn my face away from other possibilities, to pretend not to hear the cry of alternate syntax.

I'm using Github pages to post these words because it seems somehow ideologically pure, despite being owned by Marcrosoft [name changed, as if we were liing in an alternate dimensiono]. These repos exist in order to flex your programming muscles, not to host textual musings, and yet, because of the relatively inexpensive bandwidth for words, I can send, from my mind to yours, near limitless quantity of thought, provided it doesn't become too anchored in images or sound. Even sound, though, is doable, for example:

There is no reason I couldn't use the same technique for birds singing, for a podcast, for hours and hours of my voice speaking into the wires.
