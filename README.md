CONTINUITY DRIFT

: Open Process

You can only show, not tell. I learn by doing things. There is a type of learner, I think, called "kinaesthetic", and I might be an extreme version of that, who can only do things by living them.

:: Many Rodeos

This is not my first rodeo, and I have a better idea of what I want and the traps to avoid, one of which is making these readme pages aspirational rather than descriptive. In other words, making promises about future content rather than describing what is actually in the files.

:: Sustainability and Maintainability

I feel like there are metaphors to be drawn between informational, biologial, and technological ecosystems.

::Tools

I'm using bootstrap, mostly because that's what I used last time I took up this project.

:: To Do

1. test comitting what I have to github, regardless of how many other items on this list are complete.
2. Get image and text to display side by side.
3. Finish this readme file
