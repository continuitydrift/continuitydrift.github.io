<p>Learning something like a new programming language or tool is different from learning about, say, history.</p>

<p>There is no guarantee that what you learn, the time you spend in acquiring a skill, will actually be useful.</p>

<p>One bug or mistake, and a dayâ€™s progress might be wiped out.</p>

<p>Working on a novel, on the other hand, means that you can at least look back on incontrovertible, incremental progress.</p>

<p>Or can you? Programming might also be developing general skills, in the same way as research or writing. Writing, also, might end up as a fruitless or pointless endeavor.
In the end, you have to enjoy the process, and know that value is in the moment, and there is never any guarantee of long-term usefulness or relevance.</p>
