    <h2>First Steps</h2>
    <ul id="to do">
    <li><s>Push this page to repository</s></li>
    <li><s>See if I can build the site locally.</s></li>
    <li>
      Try to use Github Pages theme.
    </li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <p>
    Choosing the theme didn't seem to change anything, other than adding a `_config.yml` file.
  </p>
  <p>
    Strike that. It broke the site, because a Jekyll gem is unavailable. So far, this has been my experience with Jekyll. Now there is no easy way to undo the theme choice, except perhaps to delete the config file.
