README (sort of) for the stream

Webpage Redesign

NEW LANGUAGE


GOALS OF THIS CHANNEL OVERALL

I. Practice Streaming, figuring out the technical aspects (as you can see, I'm trying a low resolution and frame rate, to minimize CPU usage).


II. Meet other people interested in similar things, and learn from them.

GOALS FOR THIS PARTICULAR STREAM

8/31

Create a new function in my bookhandler program to take input from a terminal directly, and add book info to a JSON dictionary. I feel like this might be a better/simpler solution for now than to try to parse an existing spreadsheet. CSV is weird.

8/30

I. create a JSON file from csv values
II. add entries directly to the JSON using python script.
II. 

OKay, that's a challenge for another day. So long, internet.







I. Figure out how to turn a csv file or spreadsheet into a JSON dictionary, and ultimately display on a webpage, using datatables.

  A. See if I can export as a JSON from .ODS (highly unlikely)
  B. Create a really simple example file
  C. See if I can write some python functions to parse and present the data.

#Honestly, that is probably all I will have time for before I get bored with/weirded out by streaming. Wish me luck!

II. Create a video that I can later edit and use...somehow.
