This webpage uses Jekyll. It's been, in various iterations, online for a while, but around the turn of the decade (at the time of writing it is December, 2019) I turned back to it, hoping to improve its functionality as a repository for things that I create, think, or care about.

On Monday, April 27th, I livestreamed myself returning to these files, trying to figure them out, coax them into something more full of digital fruit.

    <h2>the story</h2>
    <p>Just as the ecosystem was collapsing, dimensional storms started opening portals to alternate earths.</p>

    <p>In one of these realities, I was the kind of person that created websites. In this branch of the multi-verse, I had no actual knowledge of how to do so, but was haunted by vauge visions of sharing online information.</p>

<!--

My methodology here is one that I have developed over many years, which is to revisit things that I've done or considered, adding fretwork details. Some things I will burn, others water.

  <h2>Notes</h2>

    I'm finishing up a year teaching English in Mexico. In the future, I would like to get into tech writing, localization testing, and amateur digital art and music.

    Before all else, I am a writer. A cybernetic exoskeleton of digital technological interests and abilities hides a musculature and organic system of narrative and language.

    This website, like others I have created or will create, is a meant to be a node connecting information, a synapse in the hive-mind.

    I might try experimenting with a website for learning English, with basic vocab, phrases, conjugation charts, etc.

A test of memory
as the sky gets light
what did I write in the notebook last night?

The transcription here can be more
about the dream version of
Borgesian submergence,
where I was much more awake and brilliant
than is evidenced by the page.

Like the things I draw, the things I write can be enhanced by digital accents and highlights.

The fate of the file is at stake.

"Now that we're here," Scape says, "we have to escape."

Teaching fills my brainspace. When students aren't paying attention, I don't take it personally, but see it as an indication that I'm not doing my job.

With freewriting, when I have intrusive pedagoigcal thoughts, I can simply write them down and move on.

Groups > Individuals.
This is why I try to steer classes towards activities in which they participate as a collective, with parity with one another, rather than endlessly make mental clones of what I'm thinking.

Language is memory
and games.

With playback controls, audio files can be sped up
we can live in a world of hyperactive faries.

"Look at the genes," the professor said, gesturing to representations, not of the genetic code, but of certain figures illustrative of that code, and its similarity to the genome of the surrounding biome.

"The only way this makes any sense is if these animals, this species, suddenly appeared in the fossil record [which had long since surpssed its limit of actual fossils], is if they dropped in from somewhere else, some other dimension where everything evolved differently."

"That is where these conspiracists and creationists are getting their strength. They can look at the data and know that there is something we're not telling them, something we are hiding, or ignoring ourselves. And they are right! Not about the cause, but about the blind spot in our thinking, the illogically persistent data that can be explained within our current paradigm."

Sometimes in order to say the things that needed said, you had to treat your career, and by extension your life, as expendable.

Words on the internet can't really survive, memetically, by themselves. They need to be part of a flowing stream, so readers know they won't just dry up dead in some stagnant puddle.

We are variously mediated and reflected masks. It makes sense for me to take the stage as a fiction seller, tending towards the truth instead of profit.
