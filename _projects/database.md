I've been working on a website for improvisational learning games to use in English language learning, and ultimately want to have a authentication feature, which would allow users to vote on games, write reviews/comments, or add their own.

The next step is to get the firebase demo project working again, but with the file and variable names changed from friendly eats to learning games.
