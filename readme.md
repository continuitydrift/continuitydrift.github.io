# Prologue

It is easy for me to get frustrated with or fixated on the things I can't get to work with technology, such as changing the theme on this github page. I have spent dozens of hours trying various permutations of the _config.yml file, installing and reinstalling gemfiles, even hiring someone from Pakistan on fivver.com to tell me why the theme wasn't working.

Again and again, I ended up back where I started, from scratch, the jekyll quick-start page, with it's minima theme, like the zero-level of a video game, the same cinematic start screen.

I am a writer, not a web designer. Nonetheless, I find myself drawn to technologies, especially those I can learn and deploy for free. I use open source programs for digital art, audio recording, and now hosting this web page.

Despite the frustrations of trying to navigate the treacherous stretches of these digital landscapes, here is the truth: the potential for expression with even the most rudimentary tools is embarrassingly large. Take this readme.md file, for example.

I can, with minimal markdown syntax, link to [an image](www.continuitydrift.github.io/drift.jpg), or [a song](www.continuitydrift.github.io/circles.mp3).  

Okay, I stand corrected. I couldn't get those links to work, even though the files exist in the repository. Theoretically, I could post them somewhere else on the internet.

Or, I can dwell within the limitations, bask in the native possibilities of simple text, use the linguistic palatte of infinite shades to paint just-bloomed Irises hanging heavy in the rain, or an alien landscape of sentient dust clouds under cerulian moons.

# Unusual Adaptations

That, I suppose, is my philosophy, not becoming a hacker but finding the obvious and elegant hacks of refusing to play, of pausing and exploring the excruciating potentials of what is readily available. Not to build machines, but grow gardens.

When I was very young my father tried to get me interested in programming with the Commodore 64, but I stalled out in the stage of trying to draw ascii pictures with the lines of printed code, the most basic and literal implementations of the functions. Missing the point, leaning forever in a doorway.

But this, this readme file, this point that I am making, a monad, a camera obscura hole, a leaning into collapsed possibilities.

There could be a whole novel here. Nothing is stopping me, technically,

and I could cough
up half
dripping
roots of
invocations.

Take a short cut through the woods, or get lost forever in fractal branches of decision trees.

Try to encourage paying attention to the paying attention, to disregard the advertisements of slicker interfaces, more CPU, more fossil fuels, when there can be words arranged on pages that blaze efficient.

the risks of unaffected honesty
flash for a second between lines like a strip of skin between shirt and underwear,
the psychological nakedness of really improvised contact between thought and syntax
something they could have for free, an open sourcing of sapio-sexual seduction, pointless, verbose, and dreaming.

# The Middle Part

In the same way, you will not see examples of stellar code, of brilliant implementation. Here do not repose the mythic beasts of solid coding. At most a playful laughing at a curious lack of learning, a yearning, a late-night stream of submerged ego. Comments buried in comments, ineffectual functions turned upon themselves, recursive introversions.

Read me, please.

# The End

There, the intoxicated musk of a self-enamored signal. Peacock flash of rust. Follow me on twitter. Put coins over my eyes. This writing was alive. It was a heron hunting fish, a crawler through the night. A test to see how long you'll stay in tune, to lay your verbs and nouns with mine.

Reach this webpage if you must. This all can continue. I will stay, and sing you songs and paint on this wall of cave (compared to the future, which will be dim but cybernetic, alien ecologies of as of yet unfallen snow).
