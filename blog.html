    <p>
      Sometimes I panic, thinking that I owe to time some kind of transmission, however unprepared, just to break the radio silence, on the off chance someone is listening. Music, ink, words, anything other than an abdication to self-censorship and the default noise.

      <h1>Vacation</h1>
      <h2>April 17th, 2019</h2>
      <p>The smell of chicken, frying in a huge vat, climbed up the walls and into my room, along with the extraordinarily loud humpingly annoying sound of at least one radio. I could somewhat block out the noise with headphones, but there was nothing I could do about the smell. Popular music and the smell of meat are two of my least favorite things in the world.
      </p><p>
        Episodes of cultural claustrophobia, when I have them, are often triggered by music that I intensely dislike and have no way of turning off. I remember a particularly terrible bus trip in Romania, going from where I lived in Ramnicu Valcea to Bucaresti, a monotonous and terrible stream of bad electronic music mixed with this genre called Manele, which was like an adaptation of Roma folk music by people who hated Roma.
      </p><p>
        In Turkey, too, the calls to prayer never bothered me but sometimes the pop radio in public places would make me break out into a cold sweat, dance music that no one was dancing too.
      </p><p>
        There is a kind of radio-voice that is emblematic of everything wrong with Capitalism, the opposite of anything pleasing or sincere, a certain kind of attention-grabbing vacuous fake-enthusiasm way of speaking that any any language grates me the wrong way, rakes my ears over coals. Some drunk uncle paid to pump a party for bratty kids, a barbeque grease-chinned pandering. It is far, far worse, when it can't be escaped.
      </p><p>
        The message, like the message of all bad music and bad faith, is on an infinite loop. It is too hot, in the middle of the day, to find somewhere else to go.
      </p><p>
        How can a group of people voluntarily subject themselves to these sounds, these smells? It isn't just Mexico--every culture, every country, has an analogue to this, a voluntary subjection to intolerable banality. Maybe I'm just a misanthrope, or elitist. I should go hiking, no matter what the cost in exhaustion and sunburn. I should also remember that as annoyed as I am, I am physically healthy, that others live with unsupressable signals that are harder to ignore.
      </p><p>
        For the last three days, I had this building, and almost this street, to myself, my landlady being gone somewhere, and the two students gone for vacation. That, maybe, is why this loss of enviornmental and aural autonomy is so annoying. I should have built up some defenses as mandolin files, which I could play as mp3s.
      </p><p>
        I need, of course, to get out of town. After hours of listening to the same 10 second loop at maximum volume, I went outside and started shouting nonsense in English at the top of my voice, to the amused shock of the people at the market. I made sure to smile, so they didn't think I was angry, and although I was frustrated, nearly driven crazy by the stupidity of such repetitive advertisment (for a rodeo, my landlady informed me) I wanted more to just inject some human spontaneity into the dead flesh of the day. I went to a cafe off the square that I'd never been to before. Music is playing, loud, from the speakers, but at least the songs change.

      <h1>basketball</h1>
      <h2>April 9th, 2019</h2>
      <p>It is okay to fail at some things.</p>
      <p>At this point in my life I only need to lean harder into the things I've always been. The writing I've grown into, the sun of sometimes purpose that the branches of my linguistic imagination have unspiraled towards, may not be well suited to social media posts, to topical memetic applications.</p>
      <p>The team I was supposed to play on was already on the court. Watching them play, I realized that was for the best. I had asked Victor, the guy who had invited me to join their team for a tournament "que nivel?" or what level, the basketball was going to be, and he had given a dismissive shrug. I told him I hadn't played for many years (in reality, around 15) but he assured me that niether had he. Seeing them now, it was obvious I had underestimated the seriousness they were bringing to the game. I had imagined a casual, pick-up style tournament, but this had a referee, an audience, and players with more than a modicum of skill.</p>
      <p>Ironically, earlier that day in my English class, I had been teaching my studnets about the subtle difference in the pronunciation of 15 and 50, but still thought that Victor told me the game would be at 7:50, so I took my time after my class ended at 7:00 clocking out at the biometric fingerprint scanner, and changing into shorts and T-shirt in my office. He'd asked if I had a purple shirt to wear, and I said no. We settled on black.</p>
      <p>"Do you want to watch the basketball tournament?" One of my students asked me ask I got closer to the court. I liked him. He was overweight, kind of awkward, but probably the best English speaker in the University. "I, um...think I might be playing in it." I said. When I saw that the game had already started, though, I sat next to him in the bleachers, feeling both relieved and kind of annoyed. I didn't want to play, but I also didn't want to watch. The student made conversation, asking where I was from. After about five minutes, just before I was about to leave, the man who had invited me to play made eye contact, and the tumbling gesture with his fingers signifying that he wanted me to take his place on the court. There was no backing out.</p>
      <p>It went as badly as you would expect. I don't even watch basketball games, and have only a very vague understanding of the rules. This, combined with the fact that I don't speak Spanish well, made for a rather embarrasing showing. I did get the ball once or twice, and managed to either shoot or pass, but I didn't know who to guard. As one of the other teachers would say in the hallway the following day, I ran a lot, but never asked for the ball. It felt like one of those dreams where you find yourself in an absurd situation for which you are entirely unprepared.</p>

      <h2>April 5th, 2019</h2>
      <p>
There was a moment when I asked myself what I was doing. With something as important as my teeth, shouldn't I at least have done a little due diligence, asked someone who lived here where a good dentists office was? Instead, on a whim, I had walked through the little half-hidden hallway on the corner by my house last night, coming home late at night after buying beer, and making an appointment with the dentist for 12:00 the next day, a Saturday. I wrote my name in a notebook, and asked about the price, a question he deflected, saying something about either a valuation or evaluation. The conversation, like all those that I have here, took place in half-understood Spanish. </p>
<!--

<p>
Now I was in a dentist's chair, with a metal instrument that looked, sounded, and felt like a tiny drill grinding against the back of my bottom teeth. Repeatedly, he tells me to <i>escupir</i> into a little basin, which fills with water and blood. My gums bleeding when I brushed them was one of the things that prompted me to go to a dentist. As were the visible streaks of tartar accumulating behind my bottom front teeth. The last time I had had them cleaned was in Turkey, five or six years ago. <!--In the United States, my parents had recommended some clinic where you could have dental students examine your teeth for reasonable rates. It took longer, but they were thorough. After an examination, though, they said that my teeth weren't messed up enough to qualify for instructional material, so they wouldn't even clean them. They recommended somewhere else, a community college or something, where I might be able to go, but I never followed up.
This isn't a simple polemeic piece about the price of health care in the U.S. versus mexico, although I'm tempted to try and politicize it. -->
As the acrid taste of whatever he had put in my mouth combined with the brown foulness of what he was scraping off, I wondered if I had made a mistake. There hadn't been, other than my writing my name in a spiral notebook, any paperwork. There was the chair and equipment and accoutrements, but was I even sure this guy was a dentist?</p>

<p>There was a language barrier in front of what he was telling me. We hadn't talked about a price.</p>
<p>
I imagined looking at my teeth afterward to find the carved, wrecked, channels the sound and sensation led me to expect, the enamel drilled through down to the core. When he showed me afterward, though, all I saw were teeth cleaned of the accumulated tartar of a decade or so. He said something, which after three repetitions I figured out was telling me to use some kind of antiseptic mouthwash, which I could find at a farmacy. He charged me 400 pesos, which is around 25 dollars.</p>
<p>
My teeth have always been a source of anxiety, prohibitive cost or laziness preventing me from having them checked out regularly. Sometimes I convince myself with frantic tongueing that I have a cavity, that a ridge or gap or crevice shouldn't feel like that, and I'll scrape at it neurotically with a fingernail.
</p>
<p>
Mexico, now, has not only gotten under my skin, but into my teeth, the most personal and sensitive of parts.</p>

    <h1>laundry</h1>
    <h2>April, 2019</h2>
    <P>There is a concrete
        basin,
        with wash-board corrugations,
        where I do my laundry by hand.
        It would be possible, I know, to find someone
        in town to do it for me, for a reasonable price.
        I don't mind it, though--it helps me think.
        Water is important here, or I am more aware
        of it's importance. It takes a lot of water to wash clothes: you fill the basin once, and add soap, and then work the soap into the fabric, and the dirt out, and then you wring the soapy water from them with your hands.
        Then you fill the basin again with clean water, let them soak, and then twist them dry again. What I learned in Romania, though, was that you really need to rinse them a third time, otherwise some of the soap will remain, and the clothes will rot on the line.
      </p>
      <p>My <i>casera</i>, or landlady, does have an automatic washer of sorts, a large plastic tub with a what looks like a boat motor on the top, but I'm afraid to use it, and feel like doing something by hand is more efficient, anyway--you can apply exactly the right amount of force and friction, rather than trusting to an automatic process.</p>
      <p>There aren't any shortcuts, really, I think as I rub and wring the clothes in the water. Only outsourcing, externalizing. I could make someone else do this work, and pay them for it. If I were to use a machine, it would just be pushing the human exertion to a greater distance, but not make it go away. Someone had to work the mines to dredge up and distill the hydrocarbons. In the long run,
      any use of petrofeuls to perform a task will
      introduce drag and inefficiency, to say nothing
      of the species deaths global destruction it will bring about.

      <h2>March, 2019</h2>
      <p>There are two poles, or genres, of blogging, I feel like, most usually occupied by this kind of reckless writing: virtue signalling, and despairing loneliness. Those are the recognized bird-calls of the species, it sometimes seems, where you are allowed to step outside normal reporting on habits of condoned consumption.
      </p>
      <p>I am niether doing wonderfully, or terribly, and want merely to assert the base-line sort of weirdness the expression of which allows me to be my actual self.
      </p>
      <h2>Tehuacan</h2>
      <h2>March, 2019</h2>
      <p>The ticket they gave me said "Techtitlan," and I thought there must have been a mistake, and started to get off the <i>combi</i> or taxi-van, that presumably was going to take me to Tehuacan, a nearby city. "No va a Tehuacan?" I asked the driver, and he assured me that it would. Oh well, I thought. It would go somewhere. Checking my phone, I saw there were only really three possible directions.
      </p>
      <p>It did go to Tehuacan, and the first thing I did was find the graffiti the van had driven by, to take a picture. Then to the main square, where I sat and drank a large Americano. Some kind of blooming tree was dropping purple petals everywhere. I watched a woman sitting with her dog, covering it with the petals.
      </p>
      <p> When I was about to leave, an older guy I had noticed came up and asked if I spoke English. A writer, retired, divorced, he didn't hesitate to tell me most of his life story. He wanted to meet regularly for a writers group. </p>
      <p>MY life is reaching a saturation point, where I have all that I need to keep me busy. It is not a stage of selection, of winnowing down, of deciding what resonates the most.</p>

    <h1>now</h1>
    <h2>March, 2019</h2>
    <p>I take it
      as a given that
      whatever is happening
      is the stage I was meant to play.
      Although I have no children,
      the states of mind I have
      grown and raised are
      worth replication.
      It is time
      for fearless practice.
      There is sweat here,
      mosquito bites,
      uncertainty
      as to bureaucratic requirements and
      bank accounts.
      But this is under my fingers.
