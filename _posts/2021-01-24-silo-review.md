# After the Silo: Book Review

Books require collaboration with memory. With a movie, the details never need to leave short-term storage. Characters and situations are brought before the mind, and then hours later are allowed to fade. Episodic television might require more long-term recall of details, but I think it reasonable to say that books generally sound off at a deeper frequency, with more distance between the summits and the troughs.

It's been a while since I read the Silo series, by Hugh Howey. Even longer, now, than when I wrote those words[^1]. Memory, though, can be an interesting lens through which to view a narrative, using yourself as an experimental subject, seeing what it is you most remember.

This review will be in two parts, the first intended for people who haven't yet read the series, and the second for those who have and won't mind spoilers.

The term speculative fiction captures my main motivation to read: to speculate. While reading you are allowed to free associate and entertain divergent currents of thought. Silo depicts a post-apocalyptic world where the entirety of the human population lives in an underground facility. Howey does a good job creating characters that provoke speculation on the psychological effects of living in a literally closed society, which, of course, can stand metaphorically for a figurative one (quite possibly our own).

The books are science fiction, though, and not allegory, so one carries into the experience expectations that the story would also suggest speculation at the level of technology or world-building. The dystopia should be one you can imagine happening, not just as a psycho-drama or exercise in symbolism. That is where the books fall somewhat short.

Another friend in Chicago, with whom I was discussing this distinction, brought up Snowpiercer, which is enjoyable as sociological allegory, despite being completely unrealistic. Silo, in a way, can be conceived as the train from Snowpiercer rotated 90 degrees, the vertical axis replacing the horizontal, with the front of the train, where the upper class live, lining up with the literal upper floors of the underground bunker.

## SPOILERS AFTER THIS POINT

There isn't just one Silo, but several.

The different closed societies, with the exception of their "mayors," don't know of each other's existence.

Let me free associate with the title for a moment. The silos in the novel are nuclear missile silos, although (despite the terrifying scene with nuclear explosions) the real threat is airborne, engineered, flesh-eating nanites.

As one of the characters points out, they are also analogous to grain silos, in that they are meant to store human genetics, to be re-released into the world once the skies have cleared. That was one of the places where the science doesn't make any sense: the big reveal at the end is that only one of the silos is designed to survive, which would be disastrous from the point of view of population genetics, and illogical in terms of resource allocation.

I also think of academic "silos", a phrase used to describe the compartmentalization of knowledge and expertise, both within the sciences, and (as I discovered writing my PhD thesis) between the sciences and humanities.

The heroine, Juliette, traverses the space between the silos, first above ground, and then through tunneling. Ignorance of the other silos existence is one of the main tools the dystopian ruling class uses to keep the population in check.

There's a recent documentary, and endless commentary online, about how micro-targeted ads on facebook and elsewhere are creating information bubbles, fragmenting populations into ideological tribes incapable of communication or empathy. Terrence McKenna called this the "balkanization" of reality.

Looking for my next job, I'm struck by how difficult lateral moves are, how isolated from one another the career tracks have become. Sometimes I regret not staying in my lane, leveraging my degree for a traditional academic job, but other times I see myself like Juliette, struggling to forge paths between occupations. I may have had a lot of shitty jobs since I left academia for my own "cleaning" mission (it is a death sentence to merely express a wish to leave), but at least they have been different.

DYSTOPIAN FICTION IN THE TIME OF THE CORONA VIRUS

"WOOL is a story about humanity living indoors because the air outside might kill them," Howey recently tweeted.

"It was supposed to be fiction."
