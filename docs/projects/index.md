Dear theatrical aesthetes,

On the evening of the 24th of this month, next Monday, from seven to eight, Tree House Productions at Power Level Zero will be staging a loose adaptation of Act One of The Clouds, written by Aristophanes in 423 BCE.  

The play will go from 7-8pm, at the Treehouse. Bring warm clothes and flashlights. Lines will be largely improvised, and the performance will be immediately followed by a meeting where, after check-ins, consensus will be reached on how funny it was (no one is allowed to leave early).

This production of the Clouds will be a loving, self-aware satire of intellectual pretensions, performed by one or more actors, with at least one of the speeches memorized beforehand. There will be lewd and suggestive language, the active questioning of authority, and musical performances. The audience may be participated with, with care and consent.

Rehearsals are optional, and open to the curious, especially if you want to contribute acting, constumes, set design, choreography, or music. It's not too late!
