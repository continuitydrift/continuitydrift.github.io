It's getting hotter, here in Kansas. There are a lot of things I feel like I should be doing, including figuring out how to move to Estonia.

I've been streaming on my [twitch channel][twitch]. Here is the `schedule`:

| Day | Time | Stream |
| ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Monday | 9:00-10:30pm CST | Music
| Wednesday |  9:00-10:30pm CST | Writing
| Friday | 9:00-10:30 CST | Streamer's Choice (TTRPG, coding, talking)

On Thursdays I'll be doing a live stream exclusively for subscribers to my [patreon page][patreon].

There's so many projects I want to work on, so many things I want to read and create. It feels selfish to post anything, right now, not related to the protests, which I support. I will, however, add a page to my Continuity Drift [webcomic][webcomic].

I'm going to try to push this commit to my github repo, and then build the site on another machine, and hopefully this will work and get posted online.
