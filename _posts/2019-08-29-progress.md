Learning something like a new programming language or tool is different from learning about, say, history.

There is no guarantee that what you learn, the time you spend in acquiring a skill, will actually be useful.

One bug or mistake, and a day's progress might be wiped out.

Working on a novel, on the other hand, means that you can at least look back on incontrovertible, incremental progress.

Or can you? Programming might also be developing general skills, in the same way as research or writing. Writing, also, might end up as a fruitless or pointless endeavor.
In the end, you have to enjoy the process, and know that value is in the moment, and there is never any guarantee of long-term usefulness or relevance.
