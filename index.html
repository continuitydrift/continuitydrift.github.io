  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <p>
    Even though this particular instantiation is encoded in this layout and address and particular stage of my own and technology's development, in order to survive in the harsh meme economy, it needs to cast an appeal to something beyond itself, a core principle that can persist like a pattern in a protein chain, even after every cell holding it dissolves and reforms a thousand times over.

    Fiction has always been a repository for the mental processes I want ot be held accountable for. Teaching is a close second. One scale is related to the other. The voice that I project after multiple revisions is distilled from the one with which I explain how to say things in English, or in which I fumble to studio new language.
