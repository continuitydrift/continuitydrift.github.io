# Continuity Drift

## Flask

This should be a new branch of my continuity drift homepage, built in flask.

### Deleting files

I'm going to try to test pushing this change to the readme.md file, and see if it affects the main branch. If not, it will be safe to delete all the old files from my continuitydrift.github.io folder, knowing that they will return should I switch back to the default branch.

### Using Flask to create new site

I will then proceed to follow a tutorial to create a simple flask webpage.
