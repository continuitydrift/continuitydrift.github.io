CONTINUITY DRIFT

: Open Process

You can only show, not tell. I learn by doing things. There is a type of learner, I think, called "kinaesthetic", and I might be an extreme version of that, who can only learn things by living them.

:: Sustainability and Maintainability

I feel like there are metaphors to be drawn between informational, biologial, and technological ecosystems.

::Tools

I'm using bootstrap, mostly because that's what I used last time I took up this project.

:: To Do

1. test comitting what I have to github, regardless of how many other items on this list are complete.
