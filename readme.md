:Continuity Drift
::Jekyll
I started trying to create a version of my github profile page yesterday using Jekyll, with limited success.
:::Cloning Repositories
My first attempts involved cloning or forking complicated repositories, and the being unable to use them because for one reason or another the gems or dependencies prevented me from building the site.
I thought the problem might be that I was trying to host them as project pages instead of my main user page, hence why I'm trying again in this folder.
:::Using Jekyll to create new site
My next efforts involved using the ¨Jekyll New¨ command, which seemed to work okay, but the instant I tried to fiddle or add with it something broke again, usually having to do with dependencies.
:::Site From Scratch
What I'm going to attempt today is going through the steps on the actual Jekyll site, creating the files one by one rather than automatically creating a build I don't understand.
:::Themes
The thing that broke the site yesterday was trying to use a Github Pages theme. This time, as soon as I have a basic html scaffold I'm going to try to choose a theme one Github (hacker) and see if it works.
