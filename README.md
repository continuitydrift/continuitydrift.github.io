CONTINUITY DRIFT

: Open Process

You can only show, not tell. I learn by doing things. There is a type of learner, I think, called "kinaesthetic", and I might be an extreme version of that, who can only learn things by living them.

:: What is here

So far, not much. I wrote a simple script so the "about section" randomly changes on page-loads. I'm in the process of doing the same thing for images.

A while back I was into trying to break images I'd drawn into layers, and then getting those layers to move using a parallax library. The main image still works, and I'd like to add more and fine tune how they display.

::What I would like to be here

There are several other projects, either personal or "professional", that I would like to incorporate here, at least temporarily.

:: Sustainability and Maintainability

I feel like there are metaphors to be drawn between informational, biological, and technological ecosystems.

::Tools

I'm using bootstrap, mostly because that's what I used last time I took up this project.

:: To Do

1. test comitting what I have to github, regardless of how many other items on this list are complete.
2. Get image and text to display side by side.
3. Finish this readme file
