It's pretty late Friday night. I've fallen into a soft deadline of the next full moon to send out my newsletter. It will include:

1. The introductory chapter to Improvised Learning
2. Book Review of Silo
3. Link to Webpage

I could say something like: `let me be clear. I am creating a kind of token to be placed on the board for a game called digital publishing. You signing up for this Newsletter gives strength to the token. I will try to play it well, and only make moves I believe in.`
