    <h1>now</h1>
    <p>I take it
      as a given that
      whatever is happening
      is the stage I was meant to play.
      Although I have no children,
      the states of mind I have
      grown and raised are
      worth replication.
      It is time
      for fearless practice.
      There is sweat here,
      mosquito bites,
      uncertainty
      as to bureaucratic requirements and
      bank accounts.
      But this is under my fingers.
