  <h2>Notes</h2>
  <p>
    Even though this particular instantiation is encoded in this layout and address and particular stage of my own and technology's development, in order to survive in the harsh meme economy, it needs to cast an appeal to something beyond itself, a core principle that can persist like a pattern in a protein chain, even after every cell holding it dissolves and reforms a thousand times over.

    Fiction has always been a repository for the mental processes I want ot be held accountable for. Teaching is a close second. One scale is related to the other. The voice that I project after multiple revisions is distilled from the one with which I explain how to say things in English, or in which I fumble to studio new language.

    This website, like others I have created or will create, is a meant to be a node connecting information, a synapse in the hive-mind.
	</p>
	<p>
    Now that the format of the page is more or less functional, absent any cascading styles, verbiage, syntax, can start to accrete.
	</p>
	<p>
    I might try experimenting with a website for learning English, with basic vocab, phrases, conjugation charts, etc.

A test of memory
as the sky gets light
what did I write in the notebook last night?

The transcription here can be more
about the dream version of
Borgesian submergence,
where I was much more awake and brilliant
than is evidenced by the page.

Like the things I draw, the things I write can be enhanced by digical accents and highlights.

The fate of the file is at stake.

"Now that we're here," Scape says, "we have to escape."

The tilda made me think of [658-413, 7:36-7:05 (245/21) = 12wpm] the Vim editor, which, when searched for, was found in an anaconda javascript file which I couldn't run. I was about to download it, but lost the internet.

Sometime between now and when I need to leave for my office, the internet will hopefull return, however momentarily, and I can squeeze through a Git push and get this version of continuity drift up online.

Teaching fills my brainspace. When students aren't paying attention, I don't take it personally, but see it as an indication that I'm not doing my job.

With freewriting, when I have intrusive pedagoigcal thoughts, I can simply write them down and move on.

Groups > Individuals.
This is why I try to steer classes towards activities in which they participate as a collective, with parity with one another, rather than endlessly make mental clones of what I'm thinking.

Language is memory
and games.

With playback controls, audio files can be sped up
we can live in a world of hyperactive faries.

Edw4rd Sn8wden worked for D3ll, which is the company that made the laptop into which I am typing this.

"Look at the genes," the professor said, gesturing to representations, not of the genetic code, but of certain figures illustrative of that code, and its similarity to the genome of the surrounding biome.

"The only way this makes any sense is if these animals, this species, suddenly appeared in the fossil record [which had long since surpssed its limit of actual fossils], is if they dropped in from somewhere else, some other dimension where everything evolved differently."

"That is where these conspiracists and creationists are getting their strength. They can look at the data and know that there is something we're not telling them, something we are hiding, or ignoring ourselves. And they are right! Not about the cause, but about the blind spot in our thinking, the illogically persistent data that can be explained within our current paradigm."

Sometimes in order to say the things that needed said, you had to treat your career, and by extension your life, as expendable.

The expanded edition could be a kind of month-in-the-life, the final portion of a year-long process, with the goal of writing 50,000 new words and having the total for the book be 75,000.

Words on the internet can't really survive, memetically, by themselves. They need to be part of a flowing stream, so readers know they won't just dry up dead in some stagnant puddle.

We are variously mediated and reflected masks. It makes sense for me to take the stage as a fiction seller, tending towards the truth instead of profit.
