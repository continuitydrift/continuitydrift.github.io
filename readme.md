# Prologue

It is easy for me to get frustrated with or fixated on the things I can't get to work with technology, such as changing the them on this github page. I have spent dozens of hours trying various permutations of the _config.yml file, installing and reinstalling gemfiles, even hiring someone from Pakistan on fivver.com to tell me why the theme wasn't working.

Again and again, I ended up back where I started, from scratch, the jekyll quick-start page, with it's minima theme, like the zero-level of a video game, the same cinematic start screen.

I am a writer, not a web designer. Nonetheless, I find myself drawn to technologies, especially those I can learn and deploy for free. I use open source programs for digital art, audio recording, and now hosting this web page.

Despite the frustrations of trying to navigate the treacherous stretches of these digital landscapes, here is the truth: the potential for expression with even the most rudimentary tools is embarassingly large. Take this readme.md file, for example.

I can, with minimal markdown syntax, link to [an image](www.continuitydrift.github.io/drift.jpg), or [a song](www.continuitydrift.github.io/circles.mp3).  

Okay, I stand corrected. I couldn't get those links to work, even though the files exist in the repository. Theoretically, I could post them somewhere else on the internet.

Or, I can dwell within the limitations, bask in the native possibilities of simple text, use the linguistic palatte of infinite shades to paint just-bloomed Irises hanging heavy in the rain, or an alien landscape of sentient dust clouds under cerulian moons.

# Unusual Adaptations

That, I suppose, is my philosophy, not becoming a hacker but finding the obvious and elegant hacks of refusing to play, of pausing and exploring the excruciating potentials of what is readily available. Not to build machines, but grow gardens.
