# Regular Expressions in Python

# meta characters

The following are metacharacters when searching for regular expressions in python:
```
. ^ $ * + ? { } [ ] \ | ( )
```
$: I am Pantalone, obviously, the Zanni attuned to wealth.
?: Shall I, then, be dottore?
+:
{}:
[]:
.: I am Drift, the destroyer of sentences.
(): Well, I am Continuity, the tangential continuance (I am unwilling to end(and prone to endless recursions)).
\:
|: I think I am the or operator, so Or20.
^: The climber. Ascentheist cleric.

It seems like I've got this site to work, more or less.

To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts`[^posts] directory that follows the convention `YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext` and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

[^posts]: Footnote test.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

```ruby
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
```
