    <title>Continuity Drift</title>
    <!--
    There is a balance between wanting to start over and wanting to continue,
    to solve the current puzzle or think of something else,
    be in the moment yet facing towards the East.

    I have, using continuitydrift.github.io as a psychic base of operations,
    had moments of panic when realizing that the website preserves,
    as if in amber, previous, deleted versions, with no recourse to
    more permanent erasure.

    what if some future sleuth of my embarassment dredges up this evidence
    of naked naivete, the material of the spent seed of pseudo-intellect?

    Evidence of what? What would be surprising enough
    to warrant a warrant for the arrest of the resting state of my life?

    Is it really possible that there might be some created caricature,
    some curated panorama of my identity that is more viable than the one that
    exists in the real macrocosmically connected soup of molecules?


   The one where I count the words of a file, and get a score accordingly?

   Besides, the understanding most useful to the collective mind is the one that show the most tranparent process, that gives no polished veneer of venal self-preserving flattery.

      I want the kind of work I would like to do to be evident from the nature of my portfolio,
      including diachronic and syncronic cross-sections. Some of it will be aspirational, oriented towards skills I want to aquire rather than already have at my disposal. Ultimately, a web-page is a portal to other forms of communication more rooted in actual social and physical space.

      I like the performative aspects of putting thoughts online in na way that the expression includes the code, the way that you share software, and libraries.

I have a "professional" website, <a href="http://newlanguagestudio.com">New Language Studio</a>, and I've imagined this as a sandbox to practice my rudimentary skills with html, css, and javascript.

My job at the moment is teaching English at a University in Mexico. There is a computer and projector in the classroom, but no internet connection or permanent storage. How cool would it be to have python and some learning games on a usb?
