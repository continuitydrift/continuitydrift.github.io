Instead of streaming, I thought that I would write here for a while, freely, but recording the would-be stream on my computer, locally.

The fate of these words is uncertain, most likely relegated to the status of an obscure and unobserved prototype.

I dream of darwinian engines for music and poetry, where almost naturally, like plants growing in a garden, musical ideas elaborate themselves, rising to the top of some silo of conscious attention.

For example: I record an hour of myself playing piano, and then listen to it while I stream, making note, maybe, of the best six minutes.

This has to be a holographic fragment, Leibnizian monad, or Blakian universe in a sane grain of sand.

Recreate the mental states of better times, when there was more at stake, when there was a woman to prove myself to, professors to cut my rhetorical teeth against.

Tinkering, the mental space of workshop, hours of losing time in an Orrery, making models and drawing maps.

I've spent most of the day struggling with this screen, trying to turn a web cam into dollars. If not writing stories then painting metaphors of stories, peering into the mechanisms of how I generate breath and language, of how I can be in the world.

Social media shouldn't be a source of self-loathing any more than another activity that I am drawn to. I should lean into whatever my seconds are vertically pinned to.

Now, I'm going to let myself actually unwind, relax into the pre-sleep state of absorbing.
