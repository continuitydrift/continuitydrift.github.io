todo:
1-
2-table of books (shelves?)
3:figure out why the width is > 100%
::is everything in a container?

4:github
::create experimental branch and push changes?

5- fix image display
6- create columns with text/ image
7- Have the parallax image also randomly carousel.

It is the opposite of social media, where you have to compete to see how much of yourself you are willing to cut off to fit in frame...

      I want the kind of work I would like to do to be evident from the nature of my portfolio, including diachronic and syncronic cross-sections. Some of it will be aspirational, oriented towards skills I want to aquire rather than already have at my disposal. Ultimately, a web-page is a portal to other forms of communication more rooted in actual social and physical space.

          I need a camera, I thought, or I could try to simulate those waves in ink. Program a web page to show their layers in parallax.

It is important to balance out trying to get broken things to work, with the creation of information, lines in the pseudo-code of language, using methods with which I am already fluent and familair. For every column in which I struggle to get the styles to load or display correctly, there should be the satisfaction of adding words to the momentum of an existing project.
