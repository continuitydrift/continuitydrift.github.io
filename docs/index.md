## Arlecchino

*Lazzi of the Fly*: Arlecchino is hungry. He sees a fly buzzing around. He catches it, pulls off its wings, and eats it with great relish, describing the flavor as if it were a fine delicacy.

## Pantalone

*Speech on Money*: "Gold! The yellow blood of commerce! Without it, the world stops turning! My ducats are my children, my soul, my very breath! You ask me for a loan? You might as well ask me to cut off my own hand!"

## Il Dottore

*Lazzi of the Latin*: The Doctor begins a speech in gibberish Latin, mixing in food names and nonsensical syllables, claiming it to be a cure for love, but eventually concluding that the only cure is a good dinner.

## Pulcinella

*Lazzi of the Stick*: Pulcinella is asked to hold a stick. He holds it. He is asked to move it. He moves it. He is asked to hit someone with it. He hits the person who asked him. He claims he was just following orders.

## Colombina

*Speech on Men*: "Men! They are like weather vanes, turning whichever way the wind blows! They promise the moon and give you a pebble. But we women, we are the solid earth, the foundation upon which their silly castles are built!"

## Il Capitano

*Lazzi of the Sword*: The Captain tries to draw his sword to fight a mouse. The sword is stuck. He pulls and pulls, making excuses that the air is too humid, or the sword is too loyal to its sheath. Finally, he runs away, claiming the mouse was a dragon in disguise.
