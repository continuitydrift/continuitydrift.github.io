# Introduction

Continuity Drift is a project I started developing before I had an idea what it would be. It started as a web comic, but envisioned as a marketing tool for a novel. This was ten years ago. The novel turned into a series of novels, which have yet to be released.

I started using the internet back in the early 1990s, when I was still in middle school. There was this platform called Prodigy, and I remember my first attempt to communicate with some anonymous individual on a forum, selected at random, the elation of realizing it was a real person behind the words that appeared on my screen, and the disappointment realizing that they didn't want to talk to me.

Not much has changed.

Flash forward twenty years or so,
