CONTINUITY DRIFT

: Open Process

I'm learning about web design by slowly improving the appearance and functionality of this site. Ultimately, I want to be able to incorporate some parallax effects into the design. The process of creating this content will be completely transparent and open.

:: What is here?

I wrote a simple script so the "about section" randomly changes on page-loads. I'm in the process of doing the same thing for images.


::What Would an Ideal Site Look Like?

For me, it would be a cool looking but functional gateway to my own writing and other online content that I enjoy.

::Tools

I'm using bootstrap, mostly because that's what I used last time I took up this project. Eventually I might try to learn and incorporate Angular JS.

:: To Do

1. Get images to be random
2. Write Better "Books" section
3. WRite Better "Website Redesign."
