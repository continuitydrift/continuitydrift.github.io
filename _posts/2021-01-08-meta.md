The preferred way of using images is placing them in the `/assets/images/` directory and referencing them with an absolute path. Prepending the filename with `{% raw %}{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/{% endraw %}` will make sure your images display properly in feeds and such.

**HTML:**


{% raw %}<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/love.jpg" alt="continuity">{% endraw %}

![Three Foxes]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/3_foxes.jpg)

Vim, it seems, isn't ideal for removing text, at least until I learn more of the shortcuts. I like typing into it, though, the huge black space. It feels perfect for composing long and rambling epics.

This is the start of many starts, the tree of many branchings and transplantings.

# Github

These changes, theoretically, will go live to the repository, and be logged in version control as long as the continuitydrift account exists. Periodically I've tried streaming myself coding,          

Image that fills page content container by adding the `.full` class with:

**HTML:**

```html
{% raw %}<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/filename.jpg" alt="" class="full">{% endraw %}
```

**or Kramdown:**

```markdown
{% raw %}![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/filename.jpg)
{: .full}{% endraw %}
```

![Unsplash image 10]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/unsplash-image-10.jpg)
{: .full}
